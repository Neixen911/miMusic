## miMusic

A high-performance music player built using the 
Rust programming language, optimized for 
running on Raspberry Pi devices. This project 
focuses on creating an efficient, lightweight, 
and responsive audio playback experience on 
resource-constrained hardware while serving 
as an introductory project to learn Rust.

Rust is chosen over C primarily due to 
its strong focus on memory safety without 
sacrificing performance.
