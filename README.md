## miMusic

miMusic is a high-performance, terminal-based music player built with the Rust programming language, specifically optimized for Raspberry Pi and other resource-constrained hardware. The goal of this project is to deliver an efficient, lightweight, and responsive audio playback experience while also serving as a practical introduction to systems programming in Rust.

Unlike traditional C-based audio applications, miMusic leverages Rust's modern features—such as memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and strong concurrency support—without compromising on performance. This makes it a reliable and secure choice for embedded environments like the Raspberry Pi.

The app features a sleek terminal user interface (TUI), offering intuitive navigation and real-time feedback while using minimal system resources.
