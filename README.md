## miMusic

miMusic is a high-performance, terminal-based music player written entirely in Rust, designed with a focus on efficiency and low resource usage. It's built specifically for the Raspberry Pi and other constrained environments, making it an ideal music playback solution for embedded devices.
The project aims to provide:

    A smooth and responsive terminal UI (TUI)
    Minimal resource footprint
    Clean and safe systems programming using Rust
    A strong starting point for those learning Rust through a practical application

Why choosing Rust?

The goal of miMusic is to create a music player that is both as secure and as performant as possible â€” without sacrificing one for the other.
Rust makes this possible by combining:
    Memory safety by design â€“ eliminating common bugs and security vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows or null pointer dereferencing)
    High performance â€“ matching or exceeding the speed of C/C++ thanks to zero-cost abstractions and fine-grained control
    Robust concurrency â€“ enabling safe, parallel execution without the usual risks of data races

By building miMusic entirely in Rust, we aim to maximize both security and performance, making it ideal for lightweight, reliable playback on devices like the Raspberry Pi.
